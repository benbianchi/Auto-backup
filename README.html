                    <p class="title" id="title_1">Purpose</p>
                    <p class="desc">To create a two processed system that allows a system to automatically sync up rapidly editted files between multiple machines.<br>
                        A server must be set up with a user's configurations.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p class="title" id="title_2">client.js</p>
                    <p class="desc">Client.js starts with a shebang line (for us unix lovers).<br><br> A globals section is set up for easy configuration. As of now, "auth" and "path" are unused.<br>
                        The process makes a request for a specified server, asking for files to download. If there are no files to be uploaded, then we recieve a 404 error. As files are downloaded they are compiled and saved to the client's disk.</p>
                </li>

                
                <li>
                    <p class="title" id="title_3">server.js</p>
                    <p class="desc">Once again, server.js starts with a shebang file.<br>
                        A dependencies and globals section has been added for fast configuration. If you have not installed the dependecies required, you will be unable to run the script. The server does generate a log for the user to increase the scalibility of the server. If a file in the global "path" is editted (And it is not a log file) then the file will be added to the queue for sharing. As the server doles out files, it pops the queue... shortening the size of the queue.</p>

                    <p class="title" id="title_4">Conclusion</p>
                    <p class="desc">This program has taught me how easy it is to create a scalable nodejs program. Error handling is rather simple.<br> I also learned how this program will be inefficient for power, using a psuedo spinlock.</p>
